/**
 * Cash on delivery was half-wired: a shipping method's "Cash on delivery
 * allowed" box was never consulted (nothing passed `codSelected` to
 * `quoteMethods`), and nothing wrote `metadata.codAmount`, so a BoxNow voucher
 * was always booked prepaid — the courier handed over a parcel nobody had paid
 * for.
 *
 * The shop has ONE payment provider, chosen in Settings. An order is paid on
 * delivery when that provider is an offline one (`manual`: "bank transfer, cash
 * on arrival"), which is also the provider the COD surcharge is keyed on. So:
 * with an offline provider, methods that do not allow COD are not offered (in
 * the estimate or at checkout), and a delivered order records what the courier
 * must collect. The voucher already sends `codAmount` only while the order is
 * unpaid, so a bank transfer that was confirmed first is booked prepaid.
 *
 * Also here: the shipping-quote route did not import `payments/register`, so the
 * provider (and its surcharge) in the storefront estimate could differ from the
 * one checkout charged.
