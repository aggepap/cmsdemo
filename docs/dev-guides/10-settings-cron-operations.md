# 10 · Settings, scheduled jobs, updates & operations

This manual covers the parts of the CMS that are about running a site rather than editing
content. It describes the `site_settings` key/value store and its admin screen, the
scheduled-job ("cron") endpoint and every job it can run, the CMS update package format with
its release and install CLIs, and the edit-lock WebSocket relay. It also has a full
environment-variable reference, deployment and backup notes, how to add a language, how the
end-user PDF guides are rebuilt, and a troubleshooting section. Everything here comes from the
code on the `CMS` branch. Where an older document under `docs/` disagrees with the code, the
difference is called out.

## 1. File map

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/cms/core/settings/index.ts` | KV store: `getSetting`, `getSettings`, `setSetting`, `SETTINGS_TAG`, `settingTag`. Re-exports the schema. |
| `src/cms/core/settings/schema.ts` | Client-safe setting registry: `MANAGED_SETTINGS`, `EXTRA_MANAGED_KEYS`, key constants, `MODULE_LABELS`, `moduleSettingKey`, `parseMultiValue` / `formatMultiValue`, `readBooleanSetting`, `resolveLocaleSet`. |
| `src/cms/core/settings/validate.ts` | `validateSettingValue(key, def, value)`, the write-boundary check for each type. |
| `src/cms/core/settings/structured.ts` | `checkStructuredSetting(key, value)`: zod schemas and sanitisers for the JSON-valued keys. |
| `src/cms/core/settings/modules.ts` | `resolveModuleFlags(config)`, `isModuleEnabled(config, name)`. |

| `src/cms/core/cache.ts` | `CMS_CACHE_REVALIDATE = false`. The rationale is in its comment and is also covered in section 10. |
| `src/cms/core/routes/settings.ts` | `settingsGetRoute`, `settingsUpdateRoute` (route factories). |
| `src/app/api/cms/settings/route.ts` | Glue: binds the factories to `@/site.config`. |

## 2. Data model

### `site_settings`

Defined in `src/cms/db/adapters/mysql/schema/settings.ts`:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | `varchar(128)` PK | Dotted name, for example `booking.mode` or `module.commerce`. |
| `value` | `json` | Plain strings for form fields, booleans for module flags, objects/arrays for structured keys. |
| `updated_by` | `int` FK → `admin_users.id` (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) | `null` for seeds and CLI writes. |
| `updated_at` | `timestamp` | `defaultNow().onUpdateNow()`. |

Nothing else about settings is stored separately. There is no history table. Each save via the
API writes one `settings.update` audit row, and `after.changed` lists the keys written (see
[05-auth-users-security.md](05-auth-users-security.md) for the audit log).

Scheduled jobs have no tables of their own. Concurrency is controlled by the MySQL named lock
`cms-cron:<job>`, and a run that did work writes an audit row (`action: 'cron.run'`,
`actorLabel: 'cron'`, `subjectType: 'cron'`, `subjectId: <job>`).

### Setting keys

Types: `text`, `email`, `textarea`, `select`, `multiselect` (comma-separated string), `money`
(major units, normalised to `.`), `gaId`, and `boolean` (`on`/`off`). "Module" means the field's
tab is hidden while that module is off. The value is still kept and still sent on save.

**Form-managed keys (`MANAGED_SETTINGS`, rendered by `SettingsForm`)**

| Group | Key | Type | Default / fallback | Main reader |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| General | `site.supportEmail` | email | none | email reply-to, public contact |
| Analytics | `analytics.gaMeasurementId` | gaId (`^G-[A-Z0-9]{4,20}$`) | falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | `resolveGaId`, `AnalyticsLoader`, cookie declaration |
| Notifications | `notifications.inquiryEmails` | textarea | none | forms/quote notifications, `commerce/orders.ts` |
| Forms | `forms.attachments.enabled` | boolean | `off` (only exactly `on` enables) | `core/forms/attachment-runtime.ts` → contact page + `/api/contact` |
| Forms | `forms.attachments.types` | multiselect (`pdf`,`docx`,`xlsx`,`jpg`,`png`) | `pdf` | same |
| Forms | `forms.attachments.maxMb` | select (`2`,`5`,`10`,`20`) | `10` | same |
| Forms | `forms.retentionDays` | text (whole days) | none (keep for ever) | `core/forms/policy.ts` → `forms-retention` job |
| Forms | `forms.sensitiveTypes` | textarea (form types, one per line) | none | `redactSubmission`, admin routes, contact email (`isSensitive`) |
| Forms | `forms.sensitiveRetentionDays` | text (whole days) | follows `forms.retentionDays` | `forms-retention` job |
| SEO | `seo.robotsExtraDisallow` | textarea (one path per line) | none | `src/app/robots.ts` via `core/seo/setting-lines.ts` |
| SEO | `seo.sitemapExtraUrls` | textarea (one URL per line) | none | sitemap |
| Ecommerce (commerce) | `ecommerce.currency` | select `EUR`/`USD`/`GBP` | `EUR` (`DEFAULT_CURRENCY`) | `commerce/read.ts` |
| Ecommerce (commerce) | `ecommerce.paymentProvider` | select `manual`/`stripe`/`paypal`/`viva` | `manual` | `commerce/payments.ts` |
| Ecommerce (commerce) | `ecommerce.giftWrapFee` | money | 0 / free | `commerce/orders.ts` |
| Ecommerce (commerce) | `ecommerce.filters.priceControl` | select `slider`/`fields` | `slider` | `commerce/filters.ts` |
| Ecommerce (commerce) | `ecommerce.pendingOrderTtlHours` | text (whole hours) | 48. `0` turns it off | `commerce/stale-orders.ts` (cron job) |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.kinds` | multiselect `transport,stay` | both | `booking/settings-read.ts`, structured data |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.mode` | select `request`/`instant` | `request` | `booking/settings-read.ts` |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.hidePrices` | boolean | `off` | `booking/visibility.ts` via `getBookingPolicy` |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.requestOnly` | boolean | `off` | same |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.currency` | select | then `ecommerce.currency`, then EUR | `booking/read.ts` |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.timezone` | text (IANA) | `Europe/Athens` | `booking/settings-read.ts` |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.notificationEmails` | textarea | none | booking notifications |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.requestExpiryHours` | text | 72 (placeholder) | expiry sweep |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.paymentHoldMinutes` | text | 20 (placeholder) | expiry sweep |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.paymentLinkExpiryDays` | text | 7 (placeholder) | payment links |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.depositPercent` | text | 0 = full amount | payments |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.defaultCapacity` | text | 1 | allocation |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.paymentProvider` | select (same four as commerce) | `manual` | `booking/settings-read.ts` |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.paymentInstructions` | textarea | none | approval / confirmation email |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.surchargePercent.stripe` / `.paypal` / `.viva` | text | 0 | `booking/payments.ts` |
| Booking (booking) | `booking.leadTimeHours` | text | 24 (placeholder) | availability |
| Security | `security.require2fa` | select `off`/`on` | `off`. Read strictly as `=== 'on'` | `core/routes/auth-mfa.ts` |

The booking "defaults" marked *(placeholder)* appear only as form placeholders. The value
actually used when a key is unset comes from the reader in `booking/settings-read.ts`. See
[09-booking.md](09-booking.md).

**Structured keys (`EXTRA_MANAGED_KEYS`, edited by bespoke screens, validated in `structured.ts`)**

| Key | Area | Editor | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brand.identity` | Branding | `BrandSettings` | `brandIdentitySchema` |
| `brand.palette` | Branding | `BrandSettings` | `brandPaletteSchema` |
| `seo.schema` | Structured data | `StructuredDataSettings` | `schemaPolicySchema` |
| `integrations.googleReviews` | Google reviews | reviews settings | zod in `structured.ts` |
| `ecommerce.shipping` | Commerce | `ShippingSettings` | zod |
| `ecommerce.coupons` | Commerce | `CouponsManager` | zod (≤500, unique codes, percent ≤100) |
| `ecommerce.wishlist` | Commerce | `WishlistSettings` | zod |
| `ecommerce.giftCards` | Commerce | `GiftCardSettings` | zod |
| `cms.customFields` | Fields | `CustomFieldsManager` | `sanitizeCustomFieldsConfig`. Merged per collection, and **requires** `cms.customFields.baseline` |
| `cms.seoFields` | Fields | `SeoFieldsManager` | `sanitizeSeoFieldOverrides`, and **requires** `cms.seoFields.baseline` |

**Other keys**

| Key | Written by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `module.<name>` | Modules tab | One per key of `config.modules`: `commerce`, `booking`, `forms`, `seo`, `newsletter`, `customers`, `googleReviews`, `popups`, `media`, `pm` (`DEFAULT_MODULES` in `src/cms/config/config.ts`). The value **must be a JSON boolean**. A missing or non-boolean value falls back to the compile-time flag in `site.config.ts`. |
| `i18n.locales` | Languages tab | `{ editing: string[], public: string[] }`, normalised by `normalizeLocaleSettings`. |
| `integrations.googleReviews.oauthState` | `reviews-external/routes.ts` | One-time OAuth `state`. Written directly with `setSetting`, not through the API allowlist. |
| `cms.customFields.baseline`, `cms.seoFields.baseline` | PATCH body only | Not stored. They tell the route which copy the client edited, for conflict detection. |

## 3. How it works

### 3.1 Reads and caching

`getSetting(key)` wraps a single-row select in `unstable_cache` with key parts
`['cms-setting', key]`, tags `cms:settings` and `cms:setting:<key>`, and
`revalidate: CMS_CACHE_REVALIDATE` (`false`, so never on a timer). If the database is
unreachable, for example during a static build with no DB, the function logs
`[cms/settings] getSetting failed` and returns `null` **without caching** the result. Pages
degrade instead of failing the prerender.

`getSettings(keys)` runs `getSetting` for each key in parallel. Callers should not add a cache of
their own.

`setSetting(key, value, updatedBy)` upserts with `onDuplicateKeyUpdate`. This is MariaDB/MySQL
specific; a comment notes it would move behind the adapter if a Postgres adapter is added. It then
purges that key's cache (`invalidateSetting(key)`, tag `cms:setting:<key>`), so every writer —
the settings route, the Google OAuth flow, anything else — leaves readers current. Outside a
request context (seed CLIs) the purge is a no-op. The API route additionally purges
`cms:settings` after a save.

`getSettingUncached(key)` reads the row straight from the database and **throws** on a DB failure
instead of returning `null`. Use it for decisions about a value somebody just wrote: the one-use
OAuth `state`, and the baselines the settings route's conflict checks compare against.

### 3.2 Runtime overlays on compile-time config

- **Module flags.** `resolveModuleFlags(config)` reads `module.<name>` for every configured
  module. It uses the stored value only if it is a boolean, and otherwise the config default.
  Every module-gated route (`isModuleEnabled`), the admin sidebar and the cron route go through
  this function.
- **Languages.** `resolveLocaleSettings` and `resolveLocaleSet(selected, pool, must)`: an
  unset list means "all of pool". `main` (`config.defaultLocale`) is always included, and
  `public ⊆ editing ⊆ installed`.

### 3.3 The write path (`PATCH /api/cms/settings`)

`settingsUpdateRoute`:

1. Guard `requireApiPerm(PERMISSIONS.settingsWrite)` (`cms.settings.write`). Same-origin is
   enforced (the `createRoute` default).
2. Body: `z.record(string, unknown)`. The allowlist is `managedKeys(config)`, which is
   `MANAGED_SETTING_KEYS + EXTRA_MANAGED_KEYS + module.<name>… + i18n.locales`.
   **Keys outside the allowlist are silently ignored.**
3. Every allowed key is validated first (`applySettingsUpdate`); nothing is written until all of
   them pass:
   - `cms.customFields` goes through `mergeCustomFields`. Without a baseline the response is
     422. It returns 409 `conflict` if any collection in the patch differs from its baseline.
     Otherwise it does a shallow per-collection merge onto the stored value, then validates.
   - `cms.seoFields` goes through `assertSeoFieldsBaseline` (compared after sanitising), then
     validation.
   - `i18n.locales` goes through `normalizeLocaleSettings`. An invalid shape is **skipped**,
     not rejected.
   - Every other key goes through `validateSettingValue`, which dispatches by key/type: structured
     check, `module.*` must be a boolean, text ≤ 20 000 chars, email, money (`^\d+([.,]\d{1,2})?$`
     with the comma normalised), gaId, boolean, select option, multiselect options (re-encoded).
     A failure throws a 422 with `fieldErrors[key]`.
4. `revalidateTag('cms:settings')`, audit `settings.update`, then return the fresh values for all
   managed keys.

Only then are the keys written, one `setSetting` each (each purging its own cache). There is
still no transaction, so a DB error midway can leave a partial save, but a validation error
(422/409) writes nothing.

### 3.4 Scheduled jobs

The CMS has no scheduler of its own. An external scheduler calls
`POST /api/cms/cron/<job>` with header `x-cron-secret: $CMS_CRON_SECRET`. `cronRoute`
(`src/cms/core/cron/service.ts`) does the following:

1. `sameOrigin: false`, because the secret is the whole authorisation.
2. Rate limit scope `cms-cron`, 30 requests/min per client IP (in-memory, per process). A request
   with no `X-Real-IP` that carries the correct secret is counted in one shared bucket instead of
   being refused (`trustedWithoutIp`); one without the right secret is refused as before.
3. `authorizeCronRequest(header, process.env.CMS_CRON_SECRET)`. If the secret is unset or
   shorter than 32 characters, every request is refused. The comparison is
   `timingSafeEquals`. Failure returns 401.
4. `resolveCronJob(jobs, name, moduleFlags)`: the name must match `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
   (≤64 characters) and be an own key of the map. If the job's `module` is off, the response is
   404, the same as for an unknown job.
5. `runCronJob` opens a transaction only to pin one pooled connection, then runs
   `SELECT GET_LOCK('cms-cron:<job>', 0)`. If the lock is held it returns
   `{ status: 'skipped', reason: 'already_running' }`. Otherwise it runs the job, calls
   `RELEASE_LOCK` in `finally`, and returns `{ status: 'ran', result }`. If the process crashes,
   the lock is released when the connection drops.
6. A job that ran is audited as `cron.run`. The response is `{ ok: true, data: <outcome> }`.

**Registered jobs** (`src/app/api/cms/cron/[job]/route.ts`):

| Job | Module gate | Function | What it does | Suggested schedule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `content-publish-scheduled` | none | `publishDueScheduled(scheduledPublisher())` (`core/documents/publish-scheduled.ts`) | Rewrites `scheduled` documents whose time has passed to `published` (≤200 per run), audits them as `scheduler`, and revalidates. The public read already treats them as live, and the admin lists run the same function when opened, so this job keeps the stored status correct. | every 5–15 min |
| `commerce-stale-orders` | `commerce` | `cancelStaleOrders` (`commerce/stale-orders.ts`) | Cancels unpaid **online-gateway** orders older than `ecommerce.pendingOrderTtlHours` (default 48, 0 = off) through `updateOrderStatus`. Manual orders and orders with money attached are never touched. | hourly (per `.env.example`) |
| `giftcard-deliver` | `commerce` | `deliverDueGiftCards(sendGiftCardEmail)` | Sends gift-card emails whose chosen delivery date has arrived, in `config.defaultLocale`. | hourly or daily |
| `giftcard-expire` | `commerce` | `expireGiftCards` | Marks expired gift cards. | daily |
| `commerce-abandoned-reminders` | `commerce` | `processReminders({ defaultLocale })` (`commerce/abandoned.ts`) | Sends abandoned-cart reminders once carts are older than `COMMERCE_ABANDONED_DELAY_MINUTES` (default 60), capped at `COMMERCE_ABANDONED_DAILY_MAX` per rolling 24 h (default 200). | every 15 min (per `.env.example`) |
| `booking-expire` | `booking` | `expireStaleReservations` (`booking/allocation.ts`) | Lapses stale enquiries and releases abandoned payment holds. Same sweep as the legacy endpoint. | every 5 min (20-minute default hold) |
| `google-reviews-sync` | `googleReviews` | `syncAllReviewLocations` (`reviews-external/sync.ts`) | Syncs every enabled Google location one after another. Returns `{results: []}` if the integration is disabled. | nightly |
| `forms-retention` | none | `purgeExpiredSubmissions` (`core/forms/service.ts`) | Deletes submissions older than Settings → Forms → retention (sensitive types by their own period), with their attached files, in batches of 500. Does nothing while no period is set. | daily |
| `transfer-cleanup` | none | `cleanupTransfers` (`core/transfer/runtime.ts`) | Deletes Export / Import jobs (staged packages, analyses, journals) untouched for `CMS_TRANSFER_TTL_HOURS` (default 24). Packages can hold customer data, so do not leave this unscheduled. | hourly |
| `analytics-capi-flush` | none | `flushCapiQueue` (`core/analytics/capi-queue.ts`) | Retries Meta Conversions API sends that failed first time (1 min … 12 h, 6 attempts) and removes sent rows older than 30 days. Only does anything with `META_CAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN` set. | every 5–15 minutes |

The schedules above are suggestions. Only the two taken from `.env.example` are stated anywhere
in the repo.

**Legacy per-job endpoints**, still live. They accept their own secret **or** an admin session:

| Endpoint | Secret env | Session fallback | Rate limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/cms/reservations/expire` | `BOOKING_CRON_SECRET` | `reservationsWrite` | 5/min | `expireStaleReservations`: lapses stale enquiries and releases abandoned payment holds. Also in the unified map as `booking-expire`; schedule one or the other, not both. |
| `POST /api/cms/abandoned-carts/remind` | `COMMERCE_CRON_SECRET` | `ordersWrite` | 5/min | Same work as `commerce-abandoned-reminders`. Also used by the admin "Send reminders" button. |

Neither legacy guard enforces a minimum secret length. Both are module-gated with a 404.

### 3.5 Updater

A site is its own front end plus a copy of the CMS core. The updater replaces the core and
nothing else. All the safety comes from `classifyPath` in `src/cms/update/plan.mjs`:

| Class | Globs (abridged) | Install behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `base-only` | `START_HERE.md`, `.claude/**`, `qa/**`, `test/studio/**`, `test/tools/**`, `seo-audit-tool/**`, `scripts/dev-qa.mjs`, `scripts/cms-release.mjs`, `docs/**`, `releases/**`, `.cms-origin.json` | never packed |
| `glue` (checked before core) | `src/site.config.ts`, `src/lib/cms/**`, `src/lib/i18n/locale-settings.ts`, `src/lib/storage-keys.ts`, `src/components/shop/showcase-data.ts`, `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/mdx-components.tsx`, `.env.example`, `package.json` | **never written**. Packed under `glue/` only so the report can say "differs" |
| `core` | `src/cms/**`, `src/app/api/cms/**`, `src/app/admin/**` | written wholesale. Core files missing from the update are **deleted** (then empty dirs pruned) |
| `core-tests` | `test/cms/**`, `test/core/**`, `test/commerce/**`, `test/booking/**` | added/updated, never deleted |
| `scaffold` | `src/components/{account,popups,checkout,shortcodes,shop/wishlist,shop/filters}/**`, `src/components/cms/Shortcode.tsx`, `src/shortcodes/**`, `src/app/[locale]/{account,wishlist}/**` | copied **only when missing**. An existing copy is reported as "yours-already" |
| `site` | everything else | untouched (default for unknown paths) |

Unchanged files (same SHA-256) are skipped, so the resulting git diff shows only the update.

**Package** (`manifest.mjs`): a zip containing `manifest.json` (`format: 1`, `version`,
`commit`, `branch`, `builtAt`, `files[] {path, kind, sha256}`, `glue[] {path, sha256}`,
`package {dependencies, devDependencies, scripts}`, `env[]`, `modules[]`), `files/<path>` and
`glue/<path>`. `readUpdate` does not trust the manifest:

- every path is re-classified by the installer's own rules;
- every checksum is verified;
- a duplicate, missing or unlisted archive entry rejects the whole package;
- scripts must be `^[a-z][a-z0-9:-]*$`, may not be npm lifecycle names (`pre*`, `post*`,
  `install`, `prepare`, …), and their command must contain `src/cms/`.

The zip reader and writer (`zip.mjs`) is hand-written, supports only deflate or store, UTF-8 names,
no ZIP64 and no encryption, and rejects `../` or absolute entry names (zip slip) before
anything is written.

**Install** (`install.mjs` → `runInstall`):

1. Reads `package.json`. The site version comes from `src/cms/version.json`, else
   `.cms-origin.json.cmsVersion`, else "unversioned".
2. `planInstall`: an older version is `refused` (unless `--allow-downgrade`), the same version is
   `up-to-date` (unless `--reinstall`). Then it builds the file plan, the package plan
   (**additions only**: missing deps, devDeps and core scripts are added, different ranges are
   only reported), and follow-ups (env keys missing from the site's `.env.example`, module names
   not mentioned in `site.config.ts`, and `brandNotWired` if the locale layout lacks `BrandStyle`).
3. Prints the report. Without `--apply` it stops there (dry run).
4. With `--apply` it requires `git status --porcelain` to be empty (unless `--force`), writes and
   deletes files, rewrites `package.json` if needed, and updates `.cms-origin.json`
   (`cmsVersion`, `baseCommit`, `syncedAt`).
5. Runs `npm install` only if dependencies were added (`--skip-install` turns this off), then
   `npm run db:migrate` (`--skip-migrate` turns this off).

`cli.mjs` checks the archive with the **site's current** reader. If the zip carries
`src/cms/update/install.mjs`, the CLI extracts the flat `src/cms/update/*.mjs` to a temp dir
and runs **the update's own installer**. Each site therefore installs with the rules of the
version it is moving to.

### 3.6 Edit-lock relay

A Next route handler cannot upgrade to WebSocket, so `src/cms/realtime/lock-server.mjs` runs as
a separate process (`ws` package). It has no database and no auth logic of its own:

- It listens on `CMS_LOCK_WS_HOST:CMS_LOCK_WS_PORT` (default `127.0.0.1:8081`), path
  `/_ws/locks` (this must equal `LOCK_WS_PATH` in `src/cms/admin/locks/ws-url.ts`).
- `verifyClient` requires `Origin === CMS_LOCK_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) and a
  `Cookie` header. This origin check is the only CSRF protection on the path.
- Each frame (`acquire` | `release` | `takeover` | `observe`, on `document` | `order` |
  `reservation`) is re-built and POSTed to `CMS_APP_ORIGIN/api/cms/locks` with the socket's
  cookie and `x-real-ip`. The app's answer names the room, and the relay broadcasts it.
- On close it POSTs `/api/cms/locks/release` with `x-cms-lock-secret`. Every TTL/3 (at least 5 s)
  it sends one batched `/api/cms/locks/heartbeat` and pings sockets.
- Limits: 4 KB frames, a 10-token bucket per socket (refills at 1/s), at most 16 rooms per socket.
- It refuses to start if `CMS_LOCK_INTERNAL_SECRET` is shorter than 32 characters or no allowed
  origin is set.

App side: with `CMS_LOCK_INTERNAL_SECRET` unset (or shorter than 32 characters), `locksEnabled()`
is false and locking is dark. Saves are never refused. If the socket cannot connect, the editor
shows "live status unavailable" and stays editable. Details are in
[04-admin-ui.md](04-admin-ui.md).

---

### 3.7 Site transfer (Export / Import)

`/admin/transfer` moves data between sites built on this CMS: it exports any selection to one
`.zip` and imports any selection of such a package, with per-item conflict handling. The code is
`src/cms/core/transfer/` (engine) and `src/cms/admin/transfer/` (screen). What exists today:
**content documents of every collection, media files and settings** (phase A), and the
**site-configuration tables** — script snippets, cookie categories with their services, shipping
zones with their methods, Google review locations with their synced reviews, redirects and
per-path SEO meta (phase B), and **people and transactions** — customer accounts (with addresses
and wishlist), newsletter subscribers, email suppressions, product reviews, orders (with lines,
payments and shipments), reservations (with lines, payments, events and confirmed capacity holds),
availability overrides, admin roles and admin users (phase C). `pm_head_payloads` is deliberately left out: it is compiled output of the Praion.ai
bridge, which rewrites it; transplanting it would pin one site's head markup onto another.

**Items and groups.** The unit a user ticks is an *item*, keyed so its group is always known:

| Key | Group | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `media:<uuid>` | `media` | one file (+ its AVIF companion) |
| `setting:<key>` | `settings` | one `site_settings` row from `managedKeys(config)` |
| `doc:<collection>:<translationGroupId \| id-N>` | `documents:<collection>` | one document **with all its language rows** — a translation group is never split |
| `cookie:<key>` | `cookies` | a cookie category with its services |
| `script:<slug>` | `scripts` | a script snippet |
| `shipzone:<name>` | `shipping` | a shipping zone with its methods (module `commerce`) |
| `reviewloc:<slug>` | `reviewLocations` | a Google review location with its synced reviews (module `googleReviews`) |
| `redirect:<digest>` | `redirects` | a redirect; the digest is of kind + source (a source can be 512 characters of regex) |
| `seometa:<locale>:<path>` | `seoMeta` | a per-path meta override |

**Configuration tables** (`tables/rules.ts` pure, `tables/adapters.ts` database). A row travels
with its child rows, and children are matched by NAME on the target: an overwrite updates the ones
that match and adds the rest, and never deletes rows only the target has. Write order: cookies
(25), then scripts, shipping and review locations (30) — before content, so a page's
`[script name]` / `[google-reviews location]` shortcode finds its row, and a script finds its
consent category — then redirects and SEO meta (50), after content, because an automatic redirect
belongs to a document (`document_id` is remapped; a redirect whose document is not on the target is
kept as an ordinary one). Every write goes through the admin's own rules: `snippetInputSchema` for
scripts, `checkRedirect` (exported from `routes/seo.ts`: shape, the regex safety check, loops across
the active rules) for redirects, `metaBody` for meta, `checkShippingMethod` for shipping methods (a
method checkout could not honour, such as a pickup point this site lacks, is left out and reported).
Review photos are media uuids and are remapped like images. Permissions: scripts need
`cms.scripts.manage` both ways; redirects and meta `cms.seo.*`; the others `cms.settings.*`. A
table whose module is off on the target is "cannot be imported". Redirects, SEO meta and cookie
categories can be skipped or overwritten; scripts, zones and review locations can also be copied
(`slug-2` / `Name (2)`). A create that finds the row already present — created after the preview
— is left alone; one an interrupted earlier attempt of the same item wrote (`journal.began`) is
completed instead.

`groups.ts` is the registry: write rank, the actions a conflict may take, and the permissions.
Every group needs the transfer permission **and** the area's own permission — export needs
`cms.transfer.export` + the area's read key (`contentRead`, `mediaRead`, `settingsRead`); import
needs `cms.transfer.import` + the write key. `cms.transfer.users` is reserved for the users/roles
phase. None of the three is in the default `editor` role.

**Package format** (`format.ts`, `records.ts`):

```
manifest.json            format "cms-transfer", formatVersion, cmsVersion, source site/locales/modules,
                         files[{path, group, count, sha256, bytes}], counts, customFields (always)
data/<group>/<NNNN>.jsonl  one record per line: { k: itemKey, sid: sourceId, r: record }
data/stubs.json          documents/media that are referenced but not included, by natural key
media/<uuid>[.avif]      stored bytes (zip method 0 — already compressed)
```

A document record is `{ type, translationGroupId, rows: [...] }` with every column the editor
can set plus `data`. `document_versions`, `document_relations` (rebuilt on write), editor ids and
anything secret are never exported. `integration_secrets` never travels (the target re-enters
credentials); `settings-refs.ts` also keeps edit baselines and OAuth state out, and flags keys
that change how the site works (`i18n.locales`, payment providers, `module.*`, 2FA) with a
warning in the dry run.

**References.** Relation ids and media uuids in `data` are the source site's. `refs.ts` walks the
collection's field tree (relations, images, repeaters, groups, `variations[].image`, localized
maps, custom fields under `data.custom`, `ogImageUuid`) and `richtext.ts` walks TipTap JSON
(`[popup id]` is rewritten; `[script name]` and `[google-reviews location]` are slugs and only
recorded; media URLs in links). The same transform collects references (dependency graph) and
rewrites them (import). The exhaustive `FieldKind` switch in `refs.ts` fails the build when a new
field kind is added without being classified. `document_relations` cannot be used for this: it
only indexes top-level relations.

On import a reference resolves to what this import wrote, else to the existing item with the
same natural key (document: type + slug + mapped language; media: sha256), else it is **dropped**:
a single relation or image loses its key (not `null` — the validator refuses `null` there, so a
nulled reference would fail the whole document), a list entry or locale entry is removed, and a
repeater row that lost its relation (a component without its product) or a required image is
removed. Every drop is counted in the report. A validation failure is reported with the field
and the reason (`failureMessage`), not just "Validation failed."

**Dependency closure** (`closure.ts`). Selecting an item pulls in what it references,
transitively; references never pull in their referrers (a category does not bring its products).
The user can opt a dependency out; it is then resolved by natural key on the target or dropped.
`writeOrder` sorts by group rank, then dependencies first; a cycle (related products, a setting
naming categories that are written later) is broken by writing the first member without the
missing reference and **patching** it after everything else is written.

**Conflicts** (`conflicts.ts`). Documents are matched on (type, slug, mapped language) per row:
`new`, `conflict` (one target group), `ambiguous` (rows match different target groups — only skip
or copy), `pathTaken` (another collection owns the URL — only skip or copy). The user picks a
default per group and may override per item; the server re-checks every override
(`resolveAction` → 422). Semantics:

- **Skip**: nothing written; references to it resolve to the existing item.
- **Overwrite**: each matched language row is updated in place (`updateDocument`, so it gets a
  version row and can be restored); missing languages are added to the existing group.
- **Copy**: every row gets `slug-2`, `-3`… (`nextFreeSlug`), a new translation group, and new
  `autoId` repeater ids (`global-ids.ts`) — a copied booking must not share the original's
  availability calendar (`res:<optionId>`). Copies are drafts by default.
- **Merge** (settings only): custom-field definitions are unioned per collection (this site's
  definition wins on a shared id); other object settings keep this site's keys and add missing
  ones.
- Media is never a conflict: identical bytes are reused.

Status follows the editor's publish rule (`documents/publish-rights.ts`), decided in
`transfer/publish-fields.ts`: the source status and publish/schedule dates are written only with
"Keep published content published" **and** `contentPublish` (and not for copies while "Import
copies as drafts" is on). Otherwise a new document is a draft with no publishing dates, and an
**overwrite leaves the target's status and dates untouched** — the import may change a live
page's content but never takes it live or down. A *new* document whose live write fails
validation only because this site requires something the source lacked is created as a draft
instead; an overwrite that fails validation fails that item rather than unpublishing it.

**Runtime** (no queue). Everything is a series of short requests over a job directory in
`CMS_TRANSFER_DIR` (default `.data/transfers/<uuid>/`, mode 0700, owner-checked, uuid-named):

1. Export: `POST exports/preview` (closure) → `POST exports` → `POST exports/:id/step` until
   `done` (each step ≤10 s, appends to the zip via a resumable `ZipFileWriter`) → `GET download`
   (audited as `transfer.export`, `no-store`).
2. Import: `POST imports` → `PUT imports/:id/chunk?offset=N` (8 MiB raw chunks; a retried range
   overwrites itself, a gap answers 409 with the offset to resume from) → `POST complete`
   (`analyze.ts`: checks every file's sha256, zod-validates every record, computes references
   with **this** site's field definitions and finds conflicts) → `POST plan` (`plan.ts`: the dry
   run; mints translation-group ids for everything created so a resumed run can tell what it
   already wrote) → `POST step` until `done` → `GET report` (JSON or formula-safe CSV).

Only one import runs at a time (`import.lock` in the staging root, taken over after 5 minutes
without a heartbeat). The journal is written after every item and every writer is idempotent, so
a crash or a closed tab resumes where it stopped (reopen it under "Your recent imports"). The
import is **not** one transaction: each document is atomic (`createDocument`/`updateDocument`
own their transaction), settings go through `applySettingsUpdate` (the settings screen's own
validation). A step ends after the last setting so later items read the new values through the
settings cache.

Media is imported with `importMediaFile` (`core/media/service.ts`), **not** `uploadMedia`: the
bytes are stored as exported (no re-encode, so the hash — and dedup — survive), the type is
sniffed from the bytes, images must decode within `UPLOAD_MAX_PIXELS`, and the source uuid is
kept when free so media URLs in text keep working. Folders are recreated by name path.

**Zip safety** (`zip-file.ts`): entry names through `assertSafePath` from `update/zip.mjs`, a
name whitelist in `import/package.ts`, no encryption, no ZIP64, no duplicate names, ≤60 000
entries, a declared-total cap, a compression-ratio cap (200:1 above 1 MiB) and a hard
`maxOutputLength` per inflate.

**Guards added after review.**

- Analysis holds every record in memory, so data files are capped at 16 MiB each and 128 MiB together (media is not counted).
- Once analysed, an upload is closed (`StagingError('closed')`, 409). Once planned, a package cannot be re-analysed.
- The run re-checks that each record is the item its key names (`recordMatchesKey`).
- `planImport` takes the same per-job step lock as a step, and refuses a language map that sends two package languages to one site language, as well as a package whose format is newer than this site's.
- A step failing for anything other than one item releases the site-wide import lock.
- A new item whose slug was taken after the preview is recorded in `journal.clashed` and is never written to, the second pass included.
- A custom field limited to categories, none of which resolve, is left out rather than widened to every document. In merge mode, only fields that existed before the import keep this site's version.
- An export skips a media row whose file is missing on disk, with a warning and a stub, instead of failing.

**People and transactions** (`tables/people.ts` pure, `tables/people-adapters.ts` database,
`tables/row-codec.ts`). Rows are moved whole: the row codec reads each table's columns from
Drizzle (type, length, enum values, nullability) and refuses anything a column could not hold, so a
new column travels without new code. Keys are the business identity — email (lower-cased),
order/reservation reference, role name, `(slotKey, date)`, and `(product group, email, created at)`
for a review — so these rows are never copied: skip or overwrite (customers can also be merged:
this site's values kept, missing ones filled, addresses added, wishlist unioned). Links are
remapped: an order's customer by email and shipping method by zone + method name, its lines'
products (the line keeps its snapshot when the product is not here); a reservation's experience
and resource documents, its `booking_group_id` and `exp:`/`res:` calendar keys through
`bookingMaps` (a source translation group maps through the document it became; a booking option id
only changes when the experience was copied); a review's product group. **Confirmed capacity holds
travel with their reservation** — capacity is counted from them, and a reservation without them
would leave its seats sellable twice; held/released holds do not. Orders and reservations are
tagged `metadata.importedFrom`: payment and courier references still point at the source site's
accounts. An overwritten order or reservation has its child rows replaced, in one transaction.

What never travels here: password hashes unless asked for; customer tokens, payment-link token
hashes, sessions, MFA method/TOTP seed/recovery codes, `tokenVersion`, `lastLoginAt`, `version`
counters, Mailchimp ids. **Gift cards are not transferable at all**: their codes are hashed with a
per-site pepper (`CMS_GIFTCARD_PEPPER`), so a moved card could never be redeemed — and they are
money. Abandoned carts and form submissions are not transferred either.

Safeguards:
- **Personal data** (customers, subscribers, suppressions, reviews, orders, reservations, admin
  users — `pii` in the registry): export and plan are refused (422, `piiProblem`) until
  `acknowledgePii` is sent; the manifest says `containsPii`, and the screen asks for the yes.
- **Password hashes** travel only with `includePasswordHashes` (export) and are written only with
  `importPasswordHashes` (import); both need `cms.transfer.users`. Without them a new admin gets an
  unusable random bcrypt hash (set a password on the Users screen) and a new customer none
  ("forgot password" works). MFA is never transferred.
- **Authority**: roles and users need `cms.transfer.users` on top of `rolesManage` / `usersManage`.
  `checkGrantable` drops permission keys this CMS does not know and refuses a role — or an account
  whose roles — grant anything the importer does not hold (`*` only from `*`). An import never
  changes the importer's own account. A user's roles are matched by name; missing ones are left out.

**Tests** are `test/cms/transfer-*.test.ts(x)` — in `test/cms/` so the updater ships them to sites as core tests and the existing `npm test` globs run them. Most of the engine is pure and tested directly (walker, closure and write order, conflicts, planner, publish rule, zip reader/writer against hostile archives, staging and locks); the DB-bound run is covered by the QA checklist `docs/qa/12-site-transfer.html`.

**Limits and known gaps.** Taking over a stale lock is not atomic (two requests can both take over a lock that has gone stale at the same moment). Export preview and start load every selected item in one request, so "everything" on a very large site can meet a proxy timeout. No ZIP64: a package holds at most ~65 000 entries / 4 GB. Internal
links written as paths inside rich text are not rewritten. Staging is local disk, so every app
process must share one host (PM2 cluster is fine; several hosts behind a load balancer are not).
Settings overwritten by an import are listed with their previous values in the report JSON
(`previousSettings`), but are not restorable from the UI.

## 5. Admin UI

`/admin/settings` (`src/app/admin/(shell)/settings/page.tsx`) requires `settingsRead`.
`SettingsForm` builds its top-level tabs in this order:

1. One tab per `group` in `MANAGED_SETTINGS` with at least one visible field (General, Analytics,
   Notifications, SEO, Ecommerce, Booking, Security). Fields whose `module` is off are hidden.
2. Module tabs with bespoke sub-tabs (`moduleTabs`). Currently only **Ecommerce** has them:
   Shipping (plus shipping methods and courier credentials), Coupons, Wishlist, Gift cards. The
   group's plain fields sit in a "General" sub-tab.
3. **Fields**: "SEO & AEO" (`SeoFieldsManager`), then one `CustomFieldsManager` per eligible
   collection (visible, routable, not `topic`/`author`/`category`, module on).
4. Extra tabs: **Branding**, **Structured data**, and the **Praion.ai** tab (`PRAION_TAB`), which
   needs both the `pm` module and `cms.tokens.manage`.
5. **Modules**: one checkbox per `config.modules` key, labelled from `MODULE_LABELS`, with its
   `offNote` always visible.
6. **Languages**: an Editing/Public checkbox per installed locale. The main locale is fixed.

Behaviour worth knowing:

- The open tab is in the URL (`?tab=SEO`). An unknown value falls back to the first tab.
- The main **Save** sends, in one PATCH, only the `MANAGED_SETTINGS` keys, module flags and
  `i18n.locales` whose value differs from what the screen opened with (`buildSettingsPatch` in
  `src/cms/admin/settings-patch.ts`). Initial form values are stored value, else `defaultValue`,
  else the first option for a select; a shown default that is never touched stays unset.
- The bespoke sub-tabs and extra tabs have their own save buttons and state. The unsaved-changes
  guard (`useUnsavedChangesGuard`) covers only the main form.

## 6. Configuration

### 6.1 Environment variable reference

Next loads `.env.local` / `.env` itself. The tsx CLIs (`db:*`) use `load-env.ts`, where existing
env values take precedence, then `.env.local`, then `.env`. The lock relay needs
`node --env-file…` (`npm run locks` passes `.env` and `.env.local`). "Build-time" means the
value is inlined by `next build` and **must be present when building**.

| Variable | Used in | Required? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `core/paths.ts`, `core/api/same-origin.ts`, `lib/seo/schemas.ts`, `cms/config/config.ts`, `lock-server.mjs`, `core/routes/api-tokens.ts` | **Yes** (build-time) | Public origin, no trailing slash. Used for canonicals, sitemap and JSON-LD, and for the same-origin check (fails closed in production if unset). Must equal `productionOrigin` for an indexable robots.txt. Must be `https://` in production for API tokens. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `db/adapters/mysql/url.ts`, `drizzle.config.ts` | Yes, or the `DB_*` set | `mysql://user:pass@host:port/db`. Takes precedence over `DB_*`. |
| `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` (3306), `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` | same | Yes, unless `DATABASE_URL` | Composed connection. Use `127.0.0.1` (TCP), not `localhost`. |
| `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` | `modules/auth/session.ts`, `mfa-challenge.ts`, `core/email/unsubscribe.ts`, `modules/customers/token.ts` | **Yes** (≥32) | Signs admin sessions, MFA challenges, unsubscribe and customer tokens. |
| `ADMIN_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `auth/session.ts`, `session-idle.ts` | No (8) | Absolute session lifetime. |
| `ADMIN_SESSION_IDLE_MINUTES` | `auth/session-idle.ts` | No (60) | Idle timeout. Non-positive values fall back to the default. |
| `ADMIN_PATH` | `core/paths.ts`, `next.config.ts`, `src/proxy.ts`, admin pages | No (`admin`) | Admin URL segment. An invalid value falls back to `admin` with a warning. |
| `ADMIN_MFA_BYPASS_CODE` | `core/security/mfa-bypass.ts` | No. **Leave blank in production** | Development second-factor bypass. |
| `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`, `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | `core/security/captcha.ts`, `core/security/public-captcha.ts` | No (both needed to enable) | reCAPTCHA v2 on admin login, and on the public forms when Settings → Security → "Captcha on public forms" is on. `.env.example` ships Google's public **test** keys (every token passes): right for dev and tests, **refused in production** (treated as unset and logged). See §7.1 "Launch checklist". |
| `CMS_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `core/tokens/crypto.ts`, `core/tokens/service.ts` | Yes for PM bridge / stored integration secrets (≥32) | AES key source for API tokens, Google refresh token, courier credentials. **Changing it invalidates everything already stored.** |
| `CMS_GIFTCARD_PEPPER` | `commerce/giftcards/service.ts` | Yes if gift cards are used (≥32) | Peppers gift-card code hashes. **Never change it on a live shop.** |
| `CMS_CRON_SECRET` | `core/cron/service.ts` | Yes if any job is scheduled (≥32) | `x-cron-secret` for `/api/cms/cron/*`. |
| `BOOKING_CRON_SECRET` | `booking/payments.ts` (`bookingExpireRoute`) | For booking sites | Secret for `/api/cms/reservations/expire`. |
| `COMMERCE_CRON_SECRET` | `commerce/abandoned.ts` | Optional (legacy endpoint) | Secret for `/api/cms/abandoned-carts/remind`. |
| `COMMERCE_ABANDONED_DELAY_MINUTES` | `commerce/abandoned.ts` | No (60) | Cart age before a reminder is sent. |
| `COMMERCE_ABANDONED_DAILY_MAX` | `commerce/abandoned.ts` | No (200) | Reminder ceiling per rolling 24 h. |
| `CMS_UPLOAD_DIR` | `core/media/storage.ts` | No (`<cwd>/.data/uploads`) | Media storage directory. **Set it to a path outside the release dir in production.** |
| `CMS_TRANSFER_DIR` | `core/transfer/runtime.ts` | No (`<cwd>/.data/transfers`) | Export / Import staging. Holds uploaded and built packages (possibly with customer data). Outside the webroot; on the same host as every app process. |
| `CMS_TRANSFER_MAX_BYTES` | same | No (2 GiB) | Largest package accepted for import. |
| `CMS_TRANSFER_TTL_HOURS` | same | No (24) | Age after which `transfer-cleanup` deletes a job. |
| `CMS_FORM_UPLOADS_DIR` | `core/forms/attachment-runtime.ts` | No (`<cwd>/.data/form-uploads`) | Files visitors attach to the contact form (Settings → Forms). Outside the webroot, mode 0700/0600, uuid names; served only by `/api/cms/forms/{id}/attachment`. **Set it to a persistent path outside the release dir in production.** |
| `CLAMD_SOCKET` or `CLAMD_HOST` [+ `CLAMD_PORT`] | `core/security/clamav.ts` | No | Virus-scan each attachment through clamd INSTREAM. Unset: no scan. Set: fail closed — a scanner that does not answer `OK` refuses the file (`503 attachment_unscanned`). |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GRAPH_SENDER_ADDRESS` | `core/email/graph.ts` | For any email | Microsoft Graph sender. |
| `CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | same | For forms | Default recipient of form submissions. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `core/payments/stripe.ts` | If Stripe is selected | Stripe API + webhook verification. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `stripe.ts`, `CheckoutClient.tsx`, booking pay page | If Stripe (build-time) | Client key. |
| `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`, `PAYPAL_ENV` (`sandbox`/`live`) | `core/payments/paypal.ts` | If PayPal | Anything but `live` is sandbox. |
| `VIVA_CLIENT_ID`, `VIVA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `VIVA_MERCHANT_ID`, `VIVA_API_KEY`, `VIVA_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_KEY`, `VIVA_ENV` (`demo`/`live`) | `core/payments/viva.ts` | If Viva | Anything but `live` is demo. |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | `reviews-external/google.ts` | For GBP OAuth | Business Profile connection. |
| `BOXNOW_API_URL` | `commerce/couriers/boxnow.ts` | No (sandbox) | BoxNow production URL. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | `core/settings/analytics.ts` | No (build-time) | GA fallback when `analytics.gaMeasurementId` is unset. |
| `META_CAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `core/analytics/capi-queue.ts` | No (blank = no server-side events) | Meta Conversions API token. Server only — never in the admin or an export. |
| `META_CAPI_PHONE_COUNTRY_CODE` | `core/analytics/capi-queue.ts` | No (`30`) | Country code added to phone numbers typed without one, before hashing. |
| `GA4_MP_API_SECRET` | `core/analytics/ga4-mp.ts` | No (blank = refunds not sent) | GA4 Measurement Protocol secret, for `refund` events from the admin. |
| `CMS_LOCK_INTERNAL_SECRET` | `core/locks/config.ts`, `lock-server.mjs` | For edit locks (≥32) | Unset turns locking off. Relay ↔ app shared secret. |
| `CMS_LOCK_WS_PORT` / `CMS_LOCK_WS_HOST` | `lock-server.mjs` | No (8081 / 127.0.0.1) | Relay bind address. Never `0.0.0.0`. |
| `CMS_APP_ORIGIN` | `lock-server.mjs` | Yes in production | Where the relay reaches Next. The code default is `http://127.0.0.1:3000`; `.env.example` has `:3002` (dev). |
| `CMS_LOCK_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | `lock-server.mjs` | No (falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) | Required browser `Origin` for the socket. |
| `CMS_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` | `core/locks/config.ts`, `lock-server.mjs` | No (60, max 3600) | Lock TTL. The heartbeat runs every TTL/3. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_LOCK_WS_URL` | `admin/locks/ws-url.ts`, admin layout | Dev only | Override socket URL. Leave blank in production (same-origin `/_ws/locks`). |
| `NODE_ENV` | many | set by Next | `production` enables secure cookies, the fail-closed origin check, HTTPS-only tokens, and strict `X-Real-IP` rate limiting. |

`AUTH_SECRET` only appears in comments (`mdx-guard.ts`, `documents/service.ts`) as an example
of what MDX must not be able to render. It is not read anywhere. The deploy-time switches in
`docs/STAGING-SETUP.md` (`DEPLOY_DB_MIGRATE`, `DEPLOY_DB_SEED`, `DEPLOY_SKIP_ENGINE`,
`AUDIT_API_URL`) belong to `deploy.php`, which is **not** in this repository. Nothing under
`src/` or `scripts/` reads them.

### 6.2 Compile-time vs runtime

| Concern | Compile-time (`src/site.config.ts`) | Runtime (`site_settings`) |
|---|---|---|
| Modules | `modules: { commerce: true, ... }` (defaults) | `module.<name>` override |
| Languages | `locales`, `defaultLocale` (installed set) | `i18n.locales` (editing/public subsets) |
| Branding | `config.brand` / `src/site.brand.ts` fallback | `brand.identity`, `brand.palette` |
| Production host | `productionOrigin` | none |

## 7. Operations

### 7.1 Build, start and required services

| Service | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node `>=20.9.0 <25`, npm `>=10 <12` | everything | `.nvmrc` pins `20.18.0`. |
| MariaDB/MySQL | everything | utf8mb4. The app and `db:migrate` connect over TCP, so grant on `'user'@'%'` (socket auth maps to a different account). |
| Reverse proxy (Nginx) | production | **Must** set `X-Real-IP $remote_addr` (overwrite, never pass through) and forward the WebSocket upgrade for `/_ws/locks`. |
| Lock relay process | optional (edit locks) | `npm run locks`. |
| External scheduler | optional (jobs) | cron, systemd timer, or hosting panel. |
| Microsoft Graph | email | see [07-forms-email-marketing.md](07-forms-email-marketing.md). |

A release, in order:

```bash
npm ci --include=dev          # tsx and drizzle-kit are devDependencies, needed by db:migrate
npm run db:migrate            # BEFORE the new build serves traffic
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com npm run build   # env must be present at build time
npm run start                 # next start, port 3000 unless -p / PORT is given
npm run locks                 # separate long-running process (optional)
```

`next start` has no port flag in `package.json`, so it uses 3000. `npm run dev` uses 3002.
First-time setup also needs `npm run db:seed-roles` and
`npm run db:seed-admin -- you@example.com '<password>' "Name"`. Run the admin seed by hand, and
keep it out of logged deploy scripts because the password is a CLI argument.

Example PM2 layout (the process names come from the Praion production box, per
`docs/STAGING-SETUP.md`):

```bash
pm2 start npm --name site-frontend -- run start
pm2 start node --name site-locks -- --env-file-if-exists=.env src/cms/realtime/lock-server.mjs
```

Example Nginx fragment. It is illustrative and not shipped in the repo:

```nginx
location /_ws/locks {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_read_timeout 120s;
}
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    # Export / Import sends 8 MiB chunks; media uploads send up to 10 MB;
    # /api/contact carries the attachment size from Settings → Forms (+ ~24 KB).
    # Raise this if that setting is 20 MB.
    client_max_body_size 12m;
}
```

Export / Import steps are kept under 10 seconds each, so the default `proxy_read_timeout` (60 s)
is enough.

#### Launch checklist (each new site)

1. **reCAPTCHA v2 keys.** At <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin> create a v2 "I'm not a
   robot" key pair, and register **both** the apex domain and `www` (a host that is not listed
   makes the widget answer "Invalid domain for site key"). Put `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` and
   `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` in the server's `.env` — never in git, never in the admin, never in an
   export. Google's test keys from `.env.example` are refused in production: no widget is shown,
   and the log says `[cms/captcha] Google's public reCAPTCHA TEST keys are set in production`.
2. **Switch it on for the public forms** in Admin → Settings → Security → "Captcha on public
   forms" (reCAPTCHA v2). With the keys missing, nothing is shown even when it is on. The cookie
   declaration lists "Google reCAPTCHA" under Necessary by itself while it is in force.
3. **Check the headers.** Pages that can carry a form (`/`, `/<page>`, `/<locale>/<page>`) are
   served without `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` and with the reCAPTCHA hosts in the CSP; the
   fixed routes (checkout, cart, account, order, shop, booking, legal, API, admin) keep the strict
   policy. `src/cms/core/security/headers.ts` holds the rules. If Nginx adds its own CSP, it must
   allow the same hosts on those pages, or the widget is blocked there.
4. **Console noise to ignore:** requests to `maps.googleapis.com/…/gen_204?csp_test=true` blocked
   by the browser come from tracking protection or an ad blocker, not from the site's CSP.

### 7.2 Wiring the scheduler

Calling the public URL through the proxy is preferred, but a scheduler on the same host may also
call `127.0.0.1:3000` directly: a request with the correct secret is not refused for lacking
`X-Real-IP`. Keep the secret out of the crontab itself:

```bash
# /usr/local/bin/cms-cron   (chmod 700)
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
. /home/site/private/cron.env          # CMS_CRON_SECRET=..., SITE=https://example.com
curl -fsS -m 300 -X POST -H "x-cron-secret: $CMS_CRON_SECRET" "$SITE/api/cms/cron/$1"
```

```cron
*/10 * * * *  /usr/local/bin/cms-cron content-publish-scheduled
7 * * * *     /usr/local/bin/cms-cron commerce-stale-orders
*/15 * * * *  /usr/local/bin/cms-cron commerce-abandoned-reminders
20 * * * *    /usr/local/bin/cms-cron giftcard-deliver
40 3 * * *    /usr/local/bin/cms-cron giftcard-expire
15 4 * * *    /usr/local/bin/cms-cron google-reviews-sync
*/5 * * * *   /usr/local/bin/cms-cron booking-expire   # booking sites
```

Jobs for disabled modules return 404, so `curl -f` exits non-zero. Remove those lines rather than
ignore the failures. `{"ok":true,"data":{"status":"skipped","reason":"already_running"}}` is
normal when a previous run overlaps.

### 7.3 Staging (`docs/STAGING-SETUP.md`, verified)

That document describes the Praion Plesk + PM2 setup. It is untracked (it is ignored by the
`*.md` rule in `.gitignore`). What still matches the code:

- Separate DB, and a `'%'` grant (see `src/cms/db/migrate.ts` for why it uses the app pool rather
  than the drizzle-kit CLI).
- Fresh ≥32-character `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` and `CMS_LOCK_INTERNAL_SECRET` per environment.
- `CMS_APP_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:3000` and `CMS_LOCK_ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://staging…`.
- robots.txt is `noindex` on any build whose `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` differs from
  `config.productionOrigin`. `isProductionHost` in `core/paths.ts` is called from
  `src/app/robots.ts`. **Correction:** the doc says "not exactly `https://praion.gr`", but the
  comparison is against `productionOrigin` (`brand.url` in `site.config.ts`).

What does not match:

- `deploy.php`, `deploy-api.php` and the `.github/workflows` it mentions are not in this
  checkout.
- The seed scripts `db:seed-articles`, `db:seed-answers` and `db:seed-scenarios` no longer
  exist. Current seeders are `db:seed-roles`, `db:seed-site`, `db:seed-content`,
  `db:seed-cookies` and `db:brand-import`.
- `.env.example` now has 50 keys, not 46.
- `docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md` says `.env.example` ships `:3000`. It now ships
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3002`.

### 7.4 File storage and backups

The repo has no backup tooling. `backups/` is gitignored. Back up:

| What | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Database | `mysqldump --single-transaction` of `DB_NAME` | content, settings, orders, audit |
| Uploads | `CMS_UPLOAD_DIR` (default `.data/uploads`, gitignored) | Media binaries are **not** in the DB. Only the rows are. |
| Form attachments | `CMS_FORM_UPLOADS_DIR` (default `.data/form-uploads`, gitignored) | Visitor files are **not** in the DB; the row only names them. They hold personal data: back them up with the same care as the database. |
| Transfer staging | `CMS_TRANSFER_DIR` (default `.data/transfers`, gitignored) | **Do not** back it up: it is temporary and can contain customer data. `transfer-cleanup` empties it. |
| Secrets | the server `.env` | Without the same `CMS_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` a restore cannot decrypt stored integration secrets. Without the same `CMS_GIFTCARD_PEPPER`, every gift card becomes unusable. |

The local storage adapter writes to `process.cwd()/.data/uploads` by default. A deploy that
replaces the release directory would lose the files, so set `CMS_UPLOAD_DIR` to a persistent
path. `StorageAdapter` (`core/media/storage.ts`) is the place where S3 would plug in. There is no
S3 implementation.

### 7.5 Logging and monitoring

- All logging is `console.*` to stdout/stderr (PM2 logs). Prefixes to grep for:
  `[cms/settings]`, `[cms]` (rate limiter / same-origin), `[cms/api]`, `[locks]`,
  `[commerce/abandoned]`.
- The audit log (Admin → Audit, `logAudit`) records `settings.update`, `cron.run` and scheduler
  publishes (`scheduler` actor), among others.
- There is no health endpoint. `GET /api/cms/auth/me` returning **401** shows the app and its
  auth stack are up (per `docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md`).
- For cron monitoring, alert on a non-2xx from `curl -f`, or on missing `cron.run` audit rows.

---

## 8. Extending

### Recipe: add a setting

1. **Plain field.** Add an entry to `MANAGED_SETTINGS` in `src/cms/core/settings/schema.ts`
   with `key`, `label`, `type`, `group`, and optionally `description`, `placeholder`, `options`,
   `defaultValue` and `module`. Export a key constant if code reads it. Keep this file
   client-safe: do not import server modules. Use a literal key, as the
   `ecommerce.pendingOrderTtlHours` entry does, if the owning constant lives in a server module.
2. Add a reader next to the feature: `await getSetting<string>(KEY)` plus a parser that turns
   any unreadable value into the default. Booleans use `readBooleanSetting`, multiselects use
   `parseMultiValue`. Default **off** for anything security-related (see `security.require2fa`).
3. If the type needs new validation, extend `validateSettingValue`. A new `SettingFieldType` also
   needs a renderer in `SettingField` (`SettingsForm.tsx`).
4. **Structured (JSON) key.** Export the key, add it to `EXTRA_MANAGED_KEYS`, add a branch in
   `checkStructuredSetting` (zod or the owning sanitiser), and build a bespoke editor that calls
   `cmsApi.updateSiteSettings({ [KEY]: value })`. Mount it in `settings/page.tsx` through
   `moduleTabs[<Group>]` or `extraTabs`. If several admins can edit the same blob, copy the
   baseline pattern (`cms.seoFields.baseline`).
5. Tests: extend `test/cms/settings-schema.test.ts` or `test/cms/structured-settings.test.ts`.
6. Update `docs/CMS-FEATURES-FOR-PROPOSALS.md` and, if it is user-visible, the user guide
   (`docs/user-guides/src/06-rythmiseis-xristes.md`), then rebuild the PDFs.

A key that is not in `managedKeys()` is silently dropped by PATCH. This is the most common reason
a new setting "doesn't save".

### Recipe: add a cron job

1. Write the job in the owning module as `async () => Record<string, unknown>`. Make it
   idempotent and bounded (batch limit), because it can be retried. It must not assume it is the
   only runner (`GET_LOCK` covers a single job name, not related jobs).
2. Register it in `src/app/api/cms/cron/[job]/route.ts`:
   `'my-job': { module: 'commerce', run: myJob }`. The name must be lowercase kebab-case and at
   most 64 characters. Omit `module` if the job is always available.
3. If the job needs config, read it from `site_settings` (add a setting as above) or from an env
   var. Add the env var to `.env.example` with a comment so the updater reports it to sites.
4. Tests: pure decision logic goes in `test/core/cron.test.ts`, route behaviour in
   `test/core/cron-route.test.ts`, and the job's own logic next to its module.
5. Document the job and its schedule in this manual and in `.env.example`. Update
   `docs/CMS-FEATURES-FOR-PROPOSALS.md`.

### Recipe: release a new CMS version to client sites

On the base (`CMS` branch, clean tree):

```bash
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm test
npm run cms:release -- --bump minor    # bumps src/cms/version.json, commits
                                       # "chore(cms): release vX.Y.Z", tags cms-vX.Y.Z,
                                       # writes releases/cms-update-X.Y.Z.zip
git push && git push origin cms-vX.Y.Z
```

`cms:release` without `--bump` rebuilds the current version's zip. `--any-branch` overrides the
branch check and `--out <dir>` changes the output folder. The script prints the zip's SHA-256.
Record it when handing the zip over.

On each site (clean git tree):

```bash
npm run cms:update -- ../cms-update-X.Y.Z.zip           # dry run: read the report
npm run cms:update -- ../cms-update-X.Y.Z.zip --apply   # write, npm install if needed, db:migrate
```

Then act on the report:

- **Contract files that differ**: compare with
  `unzip -p <zip> glue/<path> | diff -u <path> -` and port by hand.
- **Scaffold "yours-already"**: the base's version moved on. Port anything wanted.
- **package.json differs**: raise the ranges by hand if the core needs them.
- **Missing env vars** (compared against the site's `.env.example`): add them to the server env
  and to `.env.example`.
- **Missing module flags**: add them to `src/site.config.ts` (the updater defaults them to off).
- **brandNotWired**: run `npm run db:brand-import` and wire `BrandStyle`/`BrandProvider`.

Finally run `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm test`, build with the production
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, and commit the update as one diff. To roll back before committing:
`git checkout . && git clean -fd`. Migrations that already ran are not reverted.

For a site that is too old to have `cms:update`, run the base's CLI against it:
`node src/cms/update/cli.mjs <zip> --target ../site`.

### Adding a language (`docs/ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md`, verified)

Installing a language is a code change. Enabling it is a runtime setting. Steps, corrected
against the code:

1. `src/lib/i18n/config.ts`: add the code to **both** the `Locale` union type and `locales`
   (the doc only mentions `locales`).
2. `src/site.config.ts`: `locales: [...]`. It must match step 1, which
   `test/site/config.test.ts` checks.
3. `messages/<locale>.json`: copy and translate `messages/en.json` (UI chrome only).
4. `src/lib/seo/metadata.ts`: add to `OG_LOCALE`.
5. New script only: font subsets are now in **`src/lib/fonts.ts`**, not
   `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` as the doc says.
6. Rebuild and restart.

Corrections to the doc's "Turn it on" section:

- **Enablement.** The doc says a new language arrives "Editing-only". In the code
  (`resolveLocaleSet`), if `i18n.locales` has **never been saved**, every installed locale is
  both editing and public. If it **has** been saved, the new locale is in neither list until an
  admin ticks it. It is never Editing-only automatically.
- **Main language.** The doc names Greek as the main language. It is whatever
  `config.defaultLocale` is.
- **Other hardcoded locales.** Several core paths assume `el | en`: commerce email labels
  (`commerce/orders.ts` `EMAIL_LABELS`), abandoned-cart reminders (`commerce/abandoned.ts`), the
  product feed (`commerce/feeds.ts`), the contact API schema (`src/app/api/contact/route.ts`),
  and the admin bar (`src/lib/admin-bar.ts`). Check these before shipping a third language.

---

## 9. Testing

Run a single file:

```bash
npx tsx --tsconfig ./tsconfig.test.json --test test/core/cron.test.ts
```

or the whole suite with `npm test`.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test/cms/settings-schema.test.ts` | Registry shape, `validateSettingValue`, multiselect/money/gaId rules. |
| `test/core/settings-boolean.test.ts` | `boolean` type and `readBooleanSetting`. |
| `test/cms/structured-settings.test.ts` | `checkStructuredSetting` for shipping, coupons, custom fields, etc. |
| `test/cms/brand-settings.test.tsx`, `test/cms/commerce-settings-ui.test.tsx`, `test/cms/structured-data-settings.test.tsx` | Bespoke settings editors. |
| `test/booking/settings.test.ts`, `test/commerce/stale-orders.test.ts` | Module setting readers, TTL parsing. |
| `test/cms/cookie-declaration.test.ts` | `resolveGaId` agreement between loader and declaration. |
| `test/core/cron.test.ts` | `authorizeCronRequest`, `resolveCronJob`, name validation. |
| `test/core/cron-route.test.ts` | 401/404/module-off/cross-origin behaviour of `cronRoute`. |
| `test/core/publish-scheduled.test.ts` | `publishDueScheduled`. |
| `test/core/cms-update.test.ts` | `classifyPath`, `planInstall`, `packUpdate`/`readUpdate`, zip, `runInstall`. |
| `test/tools/core-sync-plan.test.ts` | Skill-side core-sync plan (base-only). |
| `test/core/locks.test.ts`, `test/cms/edit-lock.test.ts` | Lock policy and editor lock behaviour (incl. `resolveWsUrl`). |
| `test/site/config.test.ts` | Locale lists agree between i18n config and site config. |

There is no test that exercises `settingsUpdateRoute` end to end (the allowlist, partial-write
behaviour, or baseline conflicts). The relay (`lock-server.mjs`) has no direct test either.

---

## 10. Gotchas and invariants

- **Caches never expire on a timer.** `CMS_CACHE_REVALIDATE = false`. A 300 s timer used to make
  statically rendered pages fail after background regeneration (see `core/cache.ts`). Every
  write path must purge. For settings this is built in: `setSetting` purges the key it wrote, so
  do not write `site_settings` any other way. A read that decides something about a value just
  written (a one-use token, a conflict baseline) must use `getSettingUncached`.
- **PATCH validates everything before writing anything.** A 422/409 on any key writes nothing.
  It is still not a transaction: a DB failure between two writes leaves the earlier ones stored
  (each already purged from the cache).
- **Unknown keys are silently ignored** by PATCH. An invalid `i18n.locales` shape is also skipped
  silently.
- **Module flags must be JSON booleans.** `"false"` gets a 422 at write time (F-061). The reader
  ignores anything that is not a boolean.
- **"Unset" has meaning**, for example all locales enabled, both booking kinds, 2FA optional.
  The main Save sends only the keys whose value differs from what the screen opened with
  (`buildSettingsPatch` in `admin/settings-patch.ts`), so displayed defaults stay unset. A
  field the admin actually changes is stored explicitly; one changed and changed back is not
  sent. Keys stored by older versions, which sent everything,
  stay stored.
- **Security defaults live in readers.** `security.require2fa` is `=== 'on'`. Never default a
  restrictive toggle to on in the reader.
- **Cron without `X-Real-IP`.** The rate limiter still runs before the guard. In production a
  request with no `X-Real-IP` is refused (429) **unless** it carries the correct
  `CMS_CRON_SECRET` (`rateLimit.trustedWithoutIp` in `createRoute`); such requests share one
  bucket of 30/min. A wrong or missing secret gets no way round the limiter.
- **Rate limits are in-memory per process.** With several Next instances, each has its own
  buckets.
- **Cron secrets.** `CMS_CRON_SECRET` shorter than 32 characters refuses everything. The legacy
  `BOOKING_CRON_SECRET` / `COMMERCE_CRON_SECRET` go through the same `authorizeCronRequest` check
  (32-character minimum); if they are unset or too short the endpoints fall back to session auth. Prefer the unified map, which has every job.
- **Booking expiry is in the unified map** as `booking-expire` (module `booking`). The legacy
  `/api/cms/reservations/expire` still works; schedule one of them, not both.
- **`GET_LOCK` is per job name and per server.** It does not serialise different jobs that touch
  the same rows.
- **Updater invariants.** Glue is never written. Scaffolds are never overwritten. Core files
  absent from the update are deleted, so **never hand-edit `src/cms/**`, `src/app/api/cms/**` or
  `src/app/admin/**` in a site**. `package.json` changes are additive only. Unknown paths
  default to `site`. A downgrade is refused unless explicitly allowed.
- **The updater walks the whole site tree** except `.git`, `node_modules`, `.next`, `.turbo`,
  `dist`, `coverage` and `.history`. `.data/` (uploads) is not skipped, so on a large media folder the
  walk is slow. Those files classify as `site` and are never read or hashed.
- **Lock relay needs `--env-file`.** Without it every variable is undefined and it exits at
  once. `CMS_APP_ORIGIN` must point at the real `next start` port (3000 in production), not the
  `.env.example` dev value.
- **Secrets that must never change on a live site:** `CMS_GIFTCARD_PEPPER`, and
  `CMS_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (changing it invalidates stored tokens). Rotating
  `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` signs everyone out, and unsubscribe and customer tokens issued under the
  old secret stop working.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are build-time.** Changing them in the runtime env without
  rebuilding does nothing on the client and leaves canonical URLs unchanged.

### Documentation rules that are part of every CMS change

- **`docs/CMS-FEATURES-FOR-PROPOSALS.md`** must be updated on **every** CMS change (new, removed,
  or "not yet" → "exists"), including its "Τελευταία ενημέρωση" date. It is written in plain Greek
  for clients and never claims unbuilt features. It is **not** copied to new sites (the new-site
  skill strips it, per `.claude/skills/new-site/references/strip-manifest.md`), and the updater
  classifies `docs/**` as base-only.
- **User-guide PDFs** (`docs/user-guides/*.pdf`, Greek) ship to new sites and must be updated
  whenever the admin UI changes. Edit `docs/user-guides/src/NN-*.md` (frontmatter, `[[Label]]`
  for UI chips, and blockquotes starting with a bold word for callouts), then rebuild:

  ```bash
  cd docs/user-guides/_build && npm install && node build.mjs          # all guides
  node build.mjs 06-rythmiseis-xristes                                  # one guide
  ```

  It needs a Chromium. It uses `$CHROME` or Playwright's cached
  `~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1243/...`. Commit both the `.md` source and the regenerated
  `.pdf`.
- `.gitignore` ignores `*.md` except for explicit exceptions (`docs/dev-guides/*.md`,
  `docs/user-guides/src/*.md`, `.claude/skills/**/*.md`, `START_HERE.md`, `seo-audit-tool`).
  Some `docs/*.md` files are tracked because they were added before the rule. Others, such as
  `STAGING-SETUP.md` and `AUDIT-ENGINE-SERVER-SETUP.md`, are local-only. A new top-level doc needs
  `git add -f` or a new exception.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Every admin save returns 403 "Cross-origin request rejected" | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` does not match the origin/port being served. In production, it is unset. |
| Rate-limited routes (login, cron) return 429 on first call in production | Proxy is not setting `X-Real-IP`. The log shows `[cms] No X-Real-IP…`. |
| Cron returns 401 with the right secret | `CMS_CRON_SECRET` is shorter than 32 characters or not in the Next process env. |
| Cron returns 404 | Typo in the job name, or the job's module is off (`module.<name>` or config). |
| A setting "saves" but nothing changes | Key not in `managedKeys()`, a non-boolean module flag, or a reader parsing an unexpected format. |
| Setting changed directly in the DB but not visible | Cached forever. Save any setting in the admin (it purges `cms:settings`) or restart. |
| Settings page: "Could not load the shipping methods" / connected keys | Migrations not applied: `npm run db:migrate`. |
| Lock relay exits at start | Secret shorter than 32 characters or no allowed origin. Check that `--env-file` was used. |
| Editor shows "live status unavailable" | Relay not running, Nginx not forwarding `/_ws/locks` upgrade, or wrong `CMS_APP_ORIGIN`. Editing still works. |
| `cms:update` refuses: "not a clean git checkout" | Commit or stash, or pass `--force`. |
| `cms:update` manifest error "format ... update the installer first" | The site's installer is older than the package format. Run the base's `src/cms/update/cli.mjs` with `--target`. |
| `sh: tsx: not found` in migrate | Dev dependencies not installed (`npm ci --include=dev`), or `NODE_ENV=production` was set during install. |
| Migration "access denied" while the app connects fine | MariaDB socket vs TCP account. Grant on `'%'` and use `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`. |
