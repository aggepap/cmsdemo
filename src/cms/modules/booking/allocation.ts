 *
 * Seats are DERIVED, never counted into a column. A counter plus the rows it
 * summarises are two representations of one fact, and they drift — a shape this
 * codebase has been bitten by before. Aggregating under a lock already held is a
 * single indexed SUM over a handful of rows; if volume ever makes that matter,
 * add a cached counter *and* keep `findOverbookedSlots` to prove it.
