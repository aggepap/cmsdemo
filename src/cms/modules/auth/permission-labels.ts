/**
 * How a permission key is said out loud.
 *
 * These labels lived inside the roles screen, which meant the server could not use them:
 * a refusal read "You cannot grant a permission you do not hold yourself:
 * cms.roles.manage" — a code key, to a person who has been choosing from a list that says
 * "Manage roles" the whole time. The vocabulary of the permission system belongs next to
 * the permissions, not inside one component that happens to render them.
 *
 * Safe to import from either side: no server-only dependencies.
