/**
 * The Product Manager bridge.
 *
 * A token-authenticated REST namespace at `/api/cms/pm/v1` that lets the PM SaaS
 * read this site's content and push back SEO/AEO enrichment. See
 * `docs/PM_BRIDGE_SPEC.md` for the design and `docs/PM_CONTENT_TYPES.md` for the
 * data contract the other side codes against.
 *
 * Gated by `modules.pm`, which is off by default: the bridge grants an external
 * system write access to every published page, and that is not something a site
 * should acquire by cloning a repo.
