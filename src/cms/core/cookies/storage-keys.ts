/**
 * The names a site gives what it stores in a visitor's browser.

 *
 * Pure and dependency-free on purpose: the cookie registry (server) and the
 * components that actually write the keys (client) both derive their names from
 * here, which is what keeps the published declaration and the real storage in
 * step.
