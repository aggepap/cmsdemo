/**
 * Gateway webhooks — where a payment actually becomes real.
 *
 * One endpoint per provider rather than per module: a gateway dashboard should
 * carry one URL, not one per feature. Which module an event belongs to travels
 * with the payment (Stripe metadata, PayPal `custom_id`) and comes back on the
 * event, so the handler dispatches on that.
 *
 * Two things force these routes to be written differently from every other
 * route in the codebase, and both are deliberate:
 *
 *  - **No `input:` schema.** `createRoute` parses the body with `req.json()`,
 *    which consumes it; a signature is computed over the RAW bytes, and the
 *    request is single-use. So the body is read here with `req.text()` and
 *    parsed only after it has been verified.
 *  - **`sameOrigin: false`.** A gateway posts server-to-server with no `Origin`
 *    header, which `isSameOrigin` happens to allow — but relying on that would
 *    be relying on an accident. The check is switched off explicitly, and the
 *    signature is what authenticates the request instead.
