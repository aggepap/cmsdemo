/**
 * Attaches the real providers to the registry.
 *
 * This project has no boot hook (no `instrumentation.ts`, no global bootstrap),
 * and Next builds a separate module graph per route bundle — a registration
 * performed in one route is invisible to another. So this is a side-effect
 * module: importing it registers, and every route that resolves a provider
 * imports it.
 *
 * Importing it from several places is correct, not wasteful. Module-scope code
 * runs once per graph, and `registerPaymentProvider` is idempotent by key.
 *
 *   import '@/cms/core/payments/register';
 *
 * `manualProvider` is not registered here — the registry is seeded with it, so
 * a site with no gateway configured still works.
