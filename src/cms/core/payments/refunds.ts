/**
 * Refund bookkeeping shared by both payment tables.
 *
 * ## The problem this exists for
 *
 * Both refund paths — `modules/commerce/payments.ts` for orders and
 * `modules/booking/payments.ts` for reservations — read the captured row, check
 * `status === 'captured'`, call the provider, and then insert a separate
 * negative-amount `refunded` row. The capture row is deliberately never mutated:
 * a capture and a refund are two events, and the payment history should say what
 * happened rather than only where it ended up.
 *
 * The consequence nobody intended is that `status === 'captured'` stays true
 * forever, so it is not a guard. Two refund requests for the same payment both
 * read `captured`, both pass, and both call the gateway; the only thing that
 * refuses the second one is the provider, if it happens to. There was no
 * transaction and no row lock either, so it did not even need two clicks to be
 * simultaneous.
 *
 * ## How it is fixed
 *
 * How much of a payment has already been sent back is recorded on the capture row
 * itself, under `metadata.refundedAmount`, and it is written **inside a
 * transaction that locked the row, before the provider is called**. A second
 * request blocks on the lock, then reads the amount the first one claimed and has
 * nothing left to refund. `metadata` is a JSON column that already carries
 * `captureId`, so this needs no migration — and unlike flipping `status`, it
 * keeps partial refunds coherent: a 3000-cent capture refunded 1000 twice has
 * 1000 left, which a boolean could not express.
 *
 * Pure functions only, matching the rest of `core/payments` — the two modules own
 * their own tables and do their own locking; this owns the arithmetic and the
 * rules, and `test/core/refunds.test.ts` covers them.
