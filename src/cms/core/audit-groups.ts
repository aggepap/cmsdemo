/**
 * The activity filter on the audit screen.
 *
 * ## Why grouping by action rather than by subject
 *
 * The screen's only filter used to be "Subject", whose options were the raw
 * `subject_type` values — `admin_user`, `seo_redirect`, `form_submission`. That
 * is both the wrong vocabulary and the wrong axis. Somebody opening this screen
 * is asking "show me the sign-ins", and the rows that answer it are spread
 * across several subject types (`email` for a failed login, `admin_user` for a
 * password reset) while `admin_user` simultaneously holds edits that have
 * nothing to do with signing in.
 *
 * Grouping by what HAPPENED puts the filter on the axis of the question.
 *
 * Prefix matching rather than an exhaustive list of actions: a new
 * `auth.something` is grouped correctly the day it ships. `audit-groups.test.ts`
 * reads every `logAudit` action out of the source and fails if any of them
 * falls outside every group — an ungrouped action is invisible to every filter,
 * which reads as "nothing happened" and is worse than having no filter at all.
 *
 * Plain data, no `server-only`: the page renders the options from the same
 * table the query filters with.
