/**
 * What every upload becomes before it is stored.
 *
 * An editor uploads whatever their phone or their designer handed them: a 6 MB
 * 4032x3024 JPEG with the GPS coordinates of the office in its EXIF, a PNG
 * screenshot four times larger than any slot it will ever sit in. Those bytes
 * used to be stored exactly as received and served to every visitor, so page
 * weight was decided by whoever last dragged a file into the media library.
 *
 * So the bytes are re-made here instead, once, at the single point every upload
 * passes through (`uploadMedia`): decoded, turned the right way up, fitted
 * inside {@link UPLOAD_MAX_WIDTH}x{@link UPLOAD_MAX_HEIGHT} without ever being
 * enlarged, and re-encoded as WebP — plus, for a still image, an AVIF of the
 * same pixels that the file route serves to browsers asking for it
 * (`./variants`). No screen opts in and none can opt out —
 * the media library, the picker behind every `f.image()` field, the brand logo
 * and favicon, product galleries, variation images and the SEO social image all
 * reach this function through the one upload route.
 *
 * Two things fall out of doing it here rather than per screen. The stored file
 * is always something sharp itself produced, never the bytes a client sent — the
 * same property the remote-image path relies on — and EXIF (including location)
 * is gone, because sharp only carries metadata across when asked to.
